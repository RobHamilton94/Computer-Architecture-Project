# Task 3

Extend your software functionality from 1. and 2. so that multiple user supplied 
sentences can be saved to the slow Flash RAM device. You will need to create your 
own data structures and “filename” (which maybe just numerical index) system for 
saving each sentence to the Flash RAM in such a way that it can later be located 
and read back into memory by your CDM8 system. 

The user should be able to provide the desired “filename” (which may be just a 
number) for each sentence stored to Flash RAM. The user should be able to re-load 
and display a previously stored sentence from the Flash RAM back into the CDM8 
system main memory, by supplying the “filename” which was used when storing a 
particular sentence. The “filename” should be used as an index to locate a 
particular previously stored sentence in the Flash RAM.
