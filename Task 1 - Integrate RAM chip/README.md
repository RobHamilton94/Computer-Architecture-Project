# Task 1

Design suitable Input/Output circuits to interface the supplied Flash RAM chip. 
The Flash RAM chip is supplied as a a Logisim Library file, so you will need to 
load this into your main design file. The supplied Flash RAM is an asynchronous 
design, and is an order of magnitude slower to acces than standard static RAM 
(as available as a standard Logisim library part). Note, the Flash RAM chip has 
an internal clock circuit, so when testing/using the chip, you will need to 
“Enable Clock Ticks” from the Logisim Simulation Menu. Write a suitable test 
program that demonstrates the CDM8 system writing (storing) data to the slow 
Flash RAM, and also reading (loading) previously stored data back from the Flash 
RAM into the CDM8 system fast memory. Save your test circuit as CW1.circ and your 
associated Assembly Code listing as CW1.asm.
