# Task 2

Add additional IO circuitry using standard Logisim Keyboard and Terminal components and 
extend your program functionality so that a user can enter the command “s”, then type 
in a short sentence, which is then saved to the Flash RAM. The display should then be 
cleared. Your program should then wait until you enter a command “r”, then read back 
the sentence data from the Flash Memory and display it on the Terminal.
